  <body> <p>
    My name is Cameron Lipp. I'm from South Orange, New Jersey, and I attend Tisch for Film & TV. I live in Third North. Some facts about me are:
    <ul>
      <li>I'm about six feet and five inches tall.</li>
      <li>I am very into circles.</li>
      <li>I once met the guy who plays The Falcon in the Marvel movies. Can we get a picture of him?</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

    There he is!

    <p>
    I hope that counts as a picture of me because I can't find any photos of myself on this computer! Oops! 
   </p>
  <p>
  These are my top 3 favorite Anthony Mackie movies!
  </p>
    <ol>
  <li>Avengers: Infinity War </li>
      <li> The Hate U Give</li>
      <li>Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</li>
  </ol>
      <p>
        As it so happens these are the only movies I have seen with Anthony Mackie in them, but as I was looking through his IMDb page, I noticed he plays a guy named <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399327/characters/nm1107001?ref_=tt_cl_t6">"Booty"</a>in the 2005 film "The Man," so that is now on my watchlist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I've talked about Anthony enough. Instead I'll talk about the Metrograph, because it is my favorite movie theater in NYC, and I'm worried that it may close down for good. Be sure to check it out once it's safe!

    This is a picture of me just in case the Anthony Mackie thing doesn't count.
